// since eQuery can be concatenated with other files that may use define,
// but not use a proper concatenation script that understands anonymous
// AMD modules. A named AMD is safest and most robust way to register.
// Lowercase equery is used because AMD module names are derived from
// file names, and eQuery is normally delivered in a lowercase file name.
// Do this after creating the global so that if an AMD module wants to call
// noConflict to hide this version of eQuery, it will work.
