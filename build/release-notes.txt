<h2>eQuery {{version}} Released</h2>

<p>This is a preview release of eQuery. We're releasing it so that everyone can start testing the code in their applications, making sure that there are no major problems.</p>

<p>You can get the code from the eQuery CDN:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.equery.com/equery-{{short_version}}.js">http://code.equery.com/equery-{{short_version}}.js</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can help us by dropping that code into your existing application and letting us know that if anything no longer works. Please <a href="http://bugs.equery.com/">file a bug</a> and be sure to mention that you're testing against eQuery {{version}}.</p>

<p>We want to encourage everyone from the community to try and <a href="http://docs.equery.com/Getting_Involved">get involved</a> in contributing back to eQuery core. We've set up a <a href="http://docs.equery.com/Getting_Involved">full page</a> of information dedicated towards becoming more involved with the team. The team is here and ready to help you help us!</p>
